# Abstract
In this project, the goal is to draw lines and shapes by a robot without telling the robot explicitly how to draw the
shape. This project can be very important and has applications in the industry of cutting, welding, drawing and
industrial design. For simplicity, we first considered drawing the English numerical digits 0 to 9 in the simulation
environment by a robotic arm. We define drawing as to make continuous lines and trajectories using a pen, which is different
from the work of an arbitrary printer. For this purpose, evolutionary algorithms were used to find the drawing pattern, and the
results were drawn in the Webots simulation environment by the irb4600 robotic arm. We studied our suggested methods in this project, and the pros and cons of each method have been examined. There are several methods used
in previous works; The most basic method is probably printers which draw line by line. There are also robots which
can draw a tree or a plant, But cannot necessarily draw a given reference photo. The advantage of our algorithm is that
it allows us to draw any desired shape by the robot without prior training and the need for large data i.e. the trajectory with respect to time (video data). This generalized
work will also be a step towards the direction of designing designer robots.
