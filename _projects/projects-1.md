Built teleoperation interfaces in ROS + Python (Tkinter) using an MVC architecture to improve reliability, operator feedback, and code maintainability.

Investigated routing/DNS/ROS master connectivity issues; implemented automated recovery routines to keep sessions stable under network stress.

Performed hardware diagnostics on the Clearpath Jackal MCU/User Power Board (re-terminated connectors, verified VBAT/power continuity) to eliminate intermittent dropouts.

Refactored a legacy codebase (readability, modularity, documentation) and standardized dev workflows for faster iteration.

Contributed to HRI studies on UI/UX, social presence, and guidance in teleoperation (e.g., avatar layers, difficulty tuning, and clarity of goals).

Created documentation, prototypes, and tutorial materials to support ongoing experiments and onboarding in the lab.
