Founded and led the development of a multi-agent robotic soccer simulation team for the RoboCup 2D League, building intelligent agents capable of coordinated play and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. Oversaw the full pipeline from codebase design and agent logic to match evaluation, integrating AI behaviors and performance analytics for iterative improvement. The project achieved 3rd place at RoboCup IranOpen 2023 and 5th place internationally at RoboCup 2024.
