Developed Dummy Paradox, a loop-themed puzzle-platformer created within 48 hours for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam. The game explores recursive time mechanics, where players manipulate past versions of themselves to solve spatial challenges. Designed and implemented core gameplay systems, level logic, and character control in Unity (C#), focusing on intuitive loop interactions and cohesive visual flow. The prototype was well-received for its clear mechanics, smooth iteration, and creative interpretation of the “Loop” theme.
