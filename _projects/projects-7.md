Developed a virtual reality exposure therapy game designed to help users gradually overcome arachnophobia through controlled interaction and desensitization. Built in Unity (C#) for the Meta Quest 3, the project simulates progressive stages of spider exposure in immersive 3D environments, allowing players to confront fear in a safe, customizable setting. Focused on balancing psychological comfort with realism, the system features adjustable intensity levels, dynamic environmental cues, and responsive feedback to track user progress.
