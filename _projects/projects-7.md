Built and tuned an autonomous line-following E-Puck in Webots (Python), focusing on reliable sensor reads, smooth turns, and stable speed control on varied track layouts. Calibrated thresholds and motion parameters to handle junctions and sharp curves with minimal drift, then iterated with quick simulation tests for consistency. Demonstrated the system in the ROBOIUT Line Follower League (2021) and achieved 1st place.
